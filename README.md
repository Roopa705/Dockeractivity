1. Make sure that the project file with code has a Dockerfile and a compose.yaml file along with required import libraries in requirements.txt
2. In Docker Desktop, open a terminal and mount the project folder.
3. Run the command - docker compose up
4. A new container is created and will be visible in the containers tab.

I gained hands-on experience in:
    Running PostgreSQL in a container.
    Building and containerizing a Python Flask app.
    Using Redis as a caching service.
